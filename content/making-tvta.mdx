TradingView Telegram Alerts is a real-time notification system designed to help traders stay on top of market movements without needing to constantly monitor charts. This tool automatically sends customized trading alerts directly to your Telegram, ensuring you never miss an opportunity. Whether it's price spikes, volume changes, or any other condition set within TradingView, this tool delivers the information you need, when you need it.

## The Problem And Solution

My client often miss key opportunities because they can't monitor the markets 24/7. _(But they are always online on Telegram.. 🤔)_

Constantly checking charts isn't practical, and TradingView's built-in notification system, while useful, isn't always enough to ensure traders stay ahead of the market in real time.

I built **TradingView Telegram Alerts** to solve this problem. This tool allows traders to set up personalized trading alerts based on their criteria in TradingView, which are then sent instantly to their Telegram account. No need to keep a constant eye on the charts—**the system sends the chart to you.**

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts are sent directly to your Telegram chat based on the custom conditions you set within TradingView.
- **Chart Snapshots**: Along with alerts, **Selenium** is used to capture real-time snapshots of your charts, providing an immediate visual context to the notification.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: The system runs 24/7, ensuring you're always informed of crucial market changes.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages a variety of modern technologies to ensure speed, scalability, and reliability:

- **FastAPI**: Powers the webhook listener, handling the real-time alert system.
- **Fly.io**: Deploys the application, ensuring global scalability and uptime.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Sends notifications to your Telegram chat in real time.
- **Selenium**: Captures snapshots of your TradingView charts, giving you visual insights along with each alert.

## How It Works

1. **Set Alerts in TradingView**: Traders configure alerts within TradingView using custom conditions based on market data.
2. **Webhook Listener**: The FastAPI application listens for incoming alerts from TradingView and processes them.
3. **Telegram Notification**: Once an alert is triggered, it’s forwarded instantly to your Telegram chat, along with a real-time snapshot of the chart for visual context.

## What Did I Learnt?

Building this tool presented several challenges, including ensuring real-time performance and managing multiple concurrent alerts. I optimized the webhook for high performance using **FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities** and leveraged **Selenium** to capture chart snapshots without disrupting the notification flow. These challenges taught me a lot about real-time data processing and integrating multiple APIs.

Imagine setting specific trading conditions on TradingView—like price crosses or volume spikes—and getting notified the moment they happen, even if you're away from your trading platform. This system listens to TradingView’s alerts and forwards them to Telegram, giving you real-time updates.

This project has the potential to be a game-changer for active traders. By automating the process of receiving real-time alerts and integrating visual snapshots, it allows traders to make quicker, more informed decisions. Whether you're a casual trader or a professional, this tool can help streamline your trading process.

## Future Plans

There are always ways to improve, and here are a few future plans:

- Expand support for multiple Telegram groups or users.
- Build a web interface to easily configure TradingView alerts and manage settings.
- Improve alert history tracking with a more robust logging system.
