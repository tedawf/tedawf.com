Hey there! I'm super excited to share one of my recent side projects: **TT4D**, short for _Toto & 4D_. It’s a fullstack web application that lets you:

- View historical Toto and 4D results
- Analyze trends
- Generate your own _lucky numbers_

This one’s especially close to home — _Toto and 4D are a true Singaporean favourite_. If you've ever waited for the 6:30pm draw results to drop or picked numbers based on car plates and birthdays, you’ll know what I mean. 😉

For now, the app focuses on **Toto** first - I wanted to build a solid **proof of concept** before expanding into 4D. Don’t worry, **4D support is coming soon**. 🚧

👉 **Live here:** [huatnumbers.com](https://huatnumbers.com)  
👨‍💻 **Source code:** [Backend](https://github.com/tedawf/tt4d) | [Frontend](https://github.com/tedawf/tt4d-web)

## 🧪 Why TT4D?

This is a **proof of concept** to explore how well this idea resonates with others. I wanted to see if combining historical lottery data with a slick, responsive UI could be both useful and fun. This project is part experiment, part playground - and 100% a learning opportunity.

And just to be clear - I’m **not a gambling addict** 😅  
This is purely for **fun** and **personal development**. I love building things that make data accessible, fast, and maybe even a bit playful.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

This was a fullstack build, powered by:

- **Python** + **FastAPI** for the backend
- **PostgreSQL** for storing 50+ years of draw results
- **Docker** + **Fly.io** for deployment
- **Next.js 15** for the frontend, statically rendered for max speed
- **TailwindCSS** + **shadcn/ui** for clean, modern styling
- **BS4 (BeautifulSoup4)** for scraping historical data

## 🧩 Challenges & Highlights

### 🕵️‍♂️ Dealing with Messy Historical Data

Everything started with the data. I scraped thousands of results, and here’s the kicker — over the years, the format _kept changing_. Some results had missing sections, and I had to write custom logic to make sure everything got parsed correctly and stored cleanly.

### ⚙️ Deploying Multiple Services

One of the most frustrating — but also super rewarding — parts of this project was figuring out how to **deploy multiple services** smoothly. I had to coordinate:

- The **frontend** (Next.js on Vercel)
- The **backend API** (FastAPI on Fly.io)
- The **PostgreSQL database**
- A **scheduled Python job** that scrapes and updates results twice a week

One of the most frustrating - but also super rewarding - parts of this project was figuring out how to **deploy multiple services** smoothly. I had to coordinate:

### ⚡ Making Data Feel Instant

Once the backend was ready, I used **Next.js 15** with static rendering to make the experience feel buttery smooth. The app supports **instant search**, **pagination**, and **optimized fetching**, so you can sift through _decades_ of data without lag.

Yes, that's **over 50 years of draw results** served instantly. This is honestly the part I’m most proud of. 🥹

## 🔮 A Little Fun with RNG

I added a **random number generator** for fun — just in case you're feeling lucky. 😏  
If you _actually_ strike Toto using it, do come back and say hi. (Or buy me kopi? 👀)

## 🚀 What’s Next?

This is just the start. Some features I’d love to experiment with:

- ✨ Deeper **statistical analysis** (like hot/cold numbers and frequency trends)
- 📊 Cleaner, more **visual data presentation**
- 🎰 A smarter, more **robust number generator**
- 🧠 Maybe even a quirky twist with **blockchain or NFTs** just for fun?

Also on the roadmap: **4D integration** - stay tuned for that!

Thanks for reading, and let me know what you think! Whether you’re into data, clean UIs, or just like a good side project story — I hope TT4D gave you a spark of inspiration.
