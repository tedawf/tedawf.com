## TL;DR

This site doesn’t track you. If you use the chatbot, messages are stored in my database so I can see what people are asking and improve the site.

## Hey 👋

Thanks for stopping by. This is my personal portfolio and blog where I share my work, projects, and thoughts. I care about privacy, so here’s a simple, no-nonsense explanation of how things work.

## What I collect (and why)

This site is mostly static. There are no accounts, no ads, and no tracking cookies watching what you do.

There are only a couple of cases where information might be stored:

### Chatbot messages

If you use the chatbot, the messages are stored in my own database. I use them purely to understand what people are asking about, spot gaps in the site, and improve the chatbot and content over time.

I’m the only one looking at this data. It’s not shared or sold. Please don’t put anything sensitive or offensive into the chat.

### Contacting me

If you email me or use the contact form, I’ll only use your email to reply and continue the conversation.

## How I use the info

Any information that’s collected is used to:

- Keep the site running properly
- Improve the site and content
- Respond to messages and feedback

That’s it.

I don’t sell, trade, or rent personal data. If you accidentally share something you’d rather not have stored, just let me know and I’ll remove it.

## Questions?

If you have questions, concerns, or just want to say hi, email me at [hello@tedawf.com](mailto:hello@tedawf.com) or use the [contact form](/contact). Happy to chat.
