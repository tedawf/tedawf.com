## Hey, Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by! This **Privacy Policy** is just here to let you know how things work around here. My website is mainly about showcasing my work, and I'm all about respecting your privacy.

## What Information I Collect (Hint: Not Much)

Honestly, this is just a static portfolio site, so I don't actively collect any personal information. There's no account creation, no tracking cookies, and definitely no sneaky data gathering.

### 1. Chatbot Conversations

If you send a message through the chatbot, it might be stored for caching and training purposes. So please avoid sharing any confidential info in the chat.

### 2. Contact Info

If you reach out via email or the contact form, the info you provide is entirely up to you. I'll only use it to reply and have a conversation with you-no funny business.

## How I Use the Info

Here's what I might do with any information I collect:

- Make sure the site is running smoothly
- Improve the website based on feedback you might share
- Respond to your questions or feedback

## Sharing Your Info (Spoiler: I Don't)

I don't sell, trade, or rent your personal info. If you shared something sensitive by accident, feel free to reach out, and I'll help you remove it.

## Security (The Internet Isn't Perfect)

I'll do my best to keep any info you share safe, but let's be real-no system is foolproof. While I'll take reasonable steps to protect your info, I can't promise 100% security.

## Policy Updates (No Surprises)

This policy is current as of **Sep 2024**. If I make any changes, I'll update it here, so you're always in the loop. Feel free to check back occasionally, but don't worry-I'm not making any big changes without letting you know.

## Got Questions?

If you any questions, concerns, or just want to say hi, drop me an email at [hello@tedawf.com](mailto:hello@tedawf.com) or use the [contact form](/contact). I'd love to hear from you!
